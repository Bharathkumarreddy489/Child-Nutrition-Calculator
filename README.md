Creating a child nutrition calculator based on the following tasks & conditions:
The calculator should be able to store the details of the child such as the name, age, gender, height and weight.
Calculate the BMI of the child using the standard BMI formula.
Display the minimum daily calorie requirement based on age. Use the below criteria to display the same:

Age b/w 0-2 years: 800 calories
Age b/w 2-4 years: 1400 calories
Age b/w 4-8 years: 1800 calories

Take as input what that child has eaten throughout the day and in what quantities.

Calculate the daily calorie consumption based on the following criteria:

Milk: 100 cal/ 100g
Egg: 155 cal/ 100g
Rice: 130 cal/ 100g
Lentils: 113 cal/ 100g

Next, compare the daily consumption with the recommended value and print if the child is undernourished or not.
